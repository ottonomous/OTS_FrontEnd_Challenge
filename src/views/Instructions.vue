        Overview
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you've made it this far you've already completed the first step by
        installing the project dependencies and starting your Vue development
        server... good job!
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Please read all instructions carefully before you begin to work on the
          exercises.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        To start, this challenge consists of 3 exercises. Please spend no more
        than 2 hours total on these; the goal is to get a sense for how you
        solve problems and implement your code - these questions are not
        designed to trick you.
      </p>
      <div class="info-box text-caption ma-auto my-6">
        <em>Tip #1:</em> Comments are a great way to explain your thinking and
        the choices you make as you work on each exercise, particularly in spots
        where you're less sure of your solution.
      </div>

      <p>
        No additional packages or libraries are required to complete this
        challenge but you may add any that you wish. Please do not modify this
        instructions component (found at
        <code>/src/views/Instructions.vue</code>) or any of the instruction text
        for the exercise (these will be clearly denoted in the code) until your
        submission has been graded. Any other code (including router, store,
        styling, and components) are free for you to modify at your discretion.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box text-caption ma-auto my-6">
        <em>Tip #2:</em> Be creative! This is an opportunity to express yourself
        through code and design.

      <h3>
        Making the repo public
      </h3>
      <p>
        <u>The work you do on this project is your own</u>. As such, you can
        make it publicly available at your discretion (on your GitHub, as part
        of a portfolio etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you plan to make this repository public,
        <u>please do not do so until after your submission has been graded</u>
        (we'll let you know when that is!). In addition, please remove or
        replace Prefect in the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> block of the root html
        file (found in <code>/public/index.html</code>) as well as the
        <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> blocks between
        the comments in that same file as well as all associated logos. Last,
        please remove or replace the Prefect logo in the root application file
        (found in <code>/src/App.vue</code>) and the associated
        <code>.svg</code> found in the assets folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you haven't modified the <code>index.html</code> file as part of your
        challenge, you can run the following command from the root of the
        project directory to automatically remove / replace all of the above:
      </p>

      <pre>
  <code>
    <span class="mr-1 user-select-none">$</span>mv public/index-template.html public/index.html && \
      rm public/{*.png,*.xml,*.ico,*.svg,*.webmanifest} && \
      mv src/assets/vue-logo.svg src/assets/logo.svg
  </code>
</pre>
